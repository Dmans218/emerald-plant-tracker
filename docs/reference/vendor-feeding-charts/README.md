## Common Feeding Principles Across All Vendors

### Universal Guidelines
1. **Start Low**: Begin with 50-75% strength for new plants
2. **Gradual Increase**: Ramp up feeding strength over vegetative period
3. **Peak Feeding**: Highest concentrations during mid-bloom (weeks 3-5)
4. **Taper Down**: Reduce feeding in final weeks before harvest
5. **Flush Period**: 1-2 weeks plain water before harvest

### pH Ranges by Growing Medium
- **Hydroponic**: 5.5-6.5 (most vendors target 5.8-6.2)
- **Coco Coir**: 5.8-6.2 (naturally buffered)
- **Soil**: 6.0-7.0 (organic buffering)

### Environmental Considerations
- **LED Lighting**: May require 10-15% higher feeding rates
- **High Temperatures**: Reduce feeding strength by 10-20%
- **High Humidity**: Monitor for calcium/magnesium deficiencies
- **CO2 Supplementation**: Can handle 15-25% higher feeding rates
