# Story 1.4: AI-Powered Cultivation Recommendations

**Epic**: 1 - Advanced Analytics and AI Recommendations
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-28
**Assigned**: Development Team
**Depends On**: Story 1.1 (Analytics Data Pipeline), Story 1.2 (Advanced Dashboard), Story 1.3 (Plant Analytics Deep Dive)

## Story

As a cannabis cultivator,
I want to receive intelligent AI-powered recommendations based on my historical cultivation data,
so that I can optimize my growing techniques, prevent problems before they occur, and improve yields.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1**: AI recommendation engine analyzes historical plant performance, environmental data, and cultivation patterns
- **AC2**: Recommendations include optimal nutrient timing, environmental adjustments, harvest predictions, and preventive actions
- **AC3**: AI system provides confidence scores and reasoning for each recommendation
- **AC4**: Recommendations update in real-time as new data is collected
- **AC5**: System learns from user feedback on recommendation effectiveness

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Existing nutrient calculator continues to provide manual calculations alongside AI suggestions
- **IV2**: Current environmental monitoring functions remain unaffected by AI processing
- **IV3**: AI recommendations complement rather than replace existing cultivation workflow
- **IV4**: Performance remains under 5 seconds for recommendation generation
