**Epic**: 1 - Advanced Analytics and AI Recommendations
**Status**: Complete
**Created**: 2025-07-03
**Assigned**: Development Team
**Depends On**: Story 1.1 (Analytics Data Pipeline Foundation)

## Story

As a cannabis cultivator,
I want an advanced dashboard that visualizes my cultivation analytics and insights,
so that I can quickly understand my plants' performance, trends, and optimization opportunities at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1**: Dashboard displays real-time analytics from the completed analytics API endpoints
- **AC2**: Interactive charts show yield predictions, growth rates, and environmental efficiency trends
- **AC3**: Cultivation recommendations are prominently displayed with actionable insights
- **AC4**: Dashboard is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **AC5**: Performance remains optimal with chart rendering and data updates

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Dashboard integrates seamlessly with existing Plant Detail pages
- **IV2**: Analytics data updates reflect changes from existing plant management operations
- **IV3**: Chart interactions don't interfere with existing navigation and functionality

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 1.1 Implementation**:

- Analytics API endpoints are available at `/api/analytics/` (not `/api/v2/` as originally planned)
- Successful endpoints: `GET /api/analytics/:plantId/latest`, `GET /api/analytics/:plantId/trends`, `POST /api/analytics/:plantId/process`
- Response format confirmed working with real cannabis cultivation data
- Background processing operational with 6-hour automated cycles

### Frontend Integration Points

**Existing React Architecture** [Source: current frontend structure]:

- React 19.1 with React Router 7 for navigation
- Chart.js 4.5 and Recharts already available for visualization
- React Hook Form 7.54 for any configuration forms
- React Hot Toast for user notifications
- Existing plant detail pages in `frontend/src/pages/PlantDetail.js`
