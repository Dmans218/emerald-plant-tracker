# Story 1.1: Analytics Data Pipeline Foundation

**Epic**: 1 - Advanced Analytics and AI Recommendations
**Status**: Complete
**Created**: 2025-07-03
**Assigned**: Development Team

## Story

As a cannabis cultivator,
I want the system to process my historical cultivation data into analytical insights,
so that I can understand patterns and trends in my growing operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1**: System processes existing plant, environment, and log data into structured analytics tables
- **AC2**: Analytics pipeline runs without impacting current application performance
- **AC3**: Historical data from PostgreSQL migration is properly integrated into analytics
- **AC4**: Data processing includes yield calculations, growth rate analysis, and environmental correlations

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Existing plant CRUD operations continue to function with <2 second response times
- **IV2**: Current environmental logging maintains real-time data entry capabilities
- **IV3**: Analytics processing occurs in background without blocking user interactions

### Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive analytics foundation with the following key components:

**Database Schema**: Created analytics_data table with PostgreSQL-specific features including JSONB for complex data storage and proper foreign key relationships to existing plants table.

**Analytics Engine Service**: Implemented `backend/services/analyticsEngine.js` with comprehensive cannabis-specific calculations:
- Yield prediction algorithms considering strain genetics, growing medium, and environmental factors
- Growth rate calculations accounting for cannabis growth stages
- Environmental efficiency scoring using VPD optimization (0.8-1.2 kPa ranges)
- Cannabis domain expertise integrated throughout calculations

**API Endpoints**: Created `/api/analytics/` endpoints (using v1 namespace instead of planned v2):
- `GET /api/analytics/:plantId/latest` - Latest analytics data
- `GET /api/analytics/:plantId/trends` - Historical trend data
- `POST /api/analytics/:plantId/process` - Manual processing trigger
- `GET /api/analytics/health` - Service health check

**Background Processing**: Implemented 6-hour automated processing cycles with manual trigger capability. Processing occurs without blocking existing operations.

**Cannabis Domain Integration**: All calculations respect cannabis-specific requirements including strain classification (indica/sativa/hybrid), growth stage milestones, and optimal environmental ranges.

### Completion Notes

Analytics foundation is fully operational with real cannabis cultivation data. System successfully processes:
- Yield predictions (e.g., 198g prediction with confidence scoring)
- Environmental efficiency scoring (16.4% average efficiency with VPD optimization)
- Growth rate calculations with cannabis stage awareness
- Comprehensive recommendations engine with actionable insights

**Performance Verified**: Existing plant CRUD operations maintain <2 second response times. Analytics processing runs in background without impacting user interactions.
