# Story 1.1: Enhanced Selection & Feedback System

## Story Information

- **Epic**: Bulk Data Management UX Enhancements
- **Story ID**: 1.1
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Points**: 8
- **Status**: Approved

## User Story

**As a** cannabis cultivator managing multiple plants
**I want** clear visual feedback when selecting data for bulk operations
**So that** I can confidently understand what data will be affected before making changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Visual selection indicators (checkboxes, highlights) for selected data points
- [ ] Selection summary showing count, date range, and tent location
- [ ] Bulk selection tools (Select All, Select by Stage, Select Range)
- [ ] Real-time feedback as selections change
- [ ] Selection state persists across modal interactions
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions work seamlessly

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components

- `SelectionSummary` component with badge and count display
- `BulkSelectionTools` component with selection buttons
- `DataTable` component with checkbox selection
- Enhanced `BulkEditModal` with selection state management

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/environment/bulk-stats` (existing - enhance response)
- `POST /api/environment/bulk-preview` (new - for selection preview)

### State Management

- Selection state in React context or Redux
- Persistence across modal open/close
- Real-time updates for selection changes

## Implementation Tasks

1. [x] Create `SelectionSummary` component with cannabis aesthetic
2. [x] Implement `BulkSelectionTools` with Select All/By Stage/Range
3. [x] Add checkbox selection to existing data tables
4. [ ] Enhance `BulkEditModal` with selection state management
5. [ ] Implement selection persistence across modal interactions
6. [ ] Add mobile touch support for selection interactions
7. [ ] Create selection preview API endpoint
8. [ ] Add real-time selection feedback
9. [ ] Write unit tests for selection components
10. [ ] Add integration tests for selection workflow

## UI/UX Specifications

### Selection Summary Component

```jsx
const SelectionSummary = ({ selectedCount, dateRange, tent }) => (
  <div className="selection-summary bg-gray-800 border border-green-500 rounded-lg p-3">
    <Badge variant="secondary" className="bg-green-600">
      {selectedCount} records selected
    </Badge>
    <span className="text-gray-300 ml-2">
      from {tent} ({dateRange})
    </span>
  </div>
);
```

### Bulk Selection Tools

```jsx
const BulkSelectionTools = () => (
  <div className="bulk-tools flex gap-2 mb-4">
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="border-green-500 text-green-500">
      Select All
    </Button>
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="border-green-500 text-green-500">
      Select by Stage
    </Button>
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="border-green-500 text-green-500">
      Select Range
    </Button>
  </div>
);
```

## Integration Points

- Existing `BulkEditModal.js` component
- Current data table components
- Existing bulk stats API
- Mobile responsive design system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Selection components follow cannabis aesthetic
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions work smoothly
- [ ] Selection state persists correctly
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify selection workflow
- [ ] Performance: selection updates in <100ms
- [ ] Accessibility: keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

## Notes

- Maintain existing dark theme and green accent colors
- Ensure selection tools work with existing bulk edit functionality
- Consider performance for large datasets (1000+ records)
- Mobile-first approach for touch interactions

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: GPT-4.1 (Cursor)

### Debug Log References

- Created SelectionSummary.js as a new reusable component for bulk selection feedback (cannabis aesthetic, green/dark theme)
- Created BulkSelectionTools.js for bulk selection actions (Select All, By Stage, Range)
- Added checkbox selection to Environment.js data table for bulk operations

### Completion Notes List

- SelectionSummary.js implemented and ready for integration
- BulkSelectionTools.js implemented and ready for integration
- Checkbox selection added to Environment.js data table

### File List

- frontend/src/components/SelectionSummary.js
- frontend/src/components/BulkSelectionTools.js
