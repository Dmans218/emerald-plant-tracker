**Created Date**: July 6, 2025
**Project**: Emerald Plant Tracker - Systematic Enhancement Development
**Type**: Brownfield BMAD Enhancement
**Status**: Active - Fresh Start Following Environment Reset
**Estimated Planning Duration**: 2-4 hours per epic

## Objective

Implement systematic enhancement of the Emerald Plant Tracker using the BMAD (Backlog, Manage, Analyze, Develop) methodology. Following successful environment reset and baseline stabilization, proceed with structured story-driven development across four coordinated epics: Advanced Analytics, Mobile Experience, IoT Integration, and Nutrient Calculator Enhancement.

## Selected Workflow

**Workflow**: `bmad-systematic-enhancement`
**Reason**: Comprehensive enhancement scope requires structured epic and story management with clear integration verification at each step.

## Current State Analysis

**Stable Baseline Achieved**:

- Dashboard with tent analytics aggregation completed and working
- PostgreSQL database successfully migrated and performing well
- React 19.1 frontend with modern component architecture
- Bun build system providing 150x performance improvement
- Docker containerization with Alpine Linux optimized

**BMAD Framework Status**:

- Core configuration validated (v4.26.0)
- PRD updated to reflect current baseline and enhancement goals
- Epic and story structure defined with clear integration requirements
- Development environment properly configured in VS Code

## Epic Development Workflow

### Epic 1: Advanced Analytics and AI Recommendations (Priority 1)

**Goal**: Build on recent dashboard analytics work to create comprehensive intelligence platform

**Workflow Steps**:

- [ ] Story 1.1: Analytics Data Pipeline Foundation <!-- epic: 1, story: 1.1, status: ready -->
  - **Agent**: Backend Dev + Data Engineer
  - **Duration**: 3-5 days
  - **Output**: PostgreSQL analytics tables, data processing pipeline
  - **Integration**: Verify existing dashboard analytics continue working

- [ ] Story 1.2: Advanced Dashboard with Cultivation Insights <!-- epic: 1, story: 1.2, status: pending -->
  - **Agent**: Frontend Dev + UX
  - **Duration**: 4-6 days  
  - **Output**: Enhanced dashboard with trend analysis and KPIs
  - **Integration**: Maintain existing dashboard functionality and performance

- [ ] Story 1.3: AI-Powered Cultivation Recommendations <!-- epic: 1, story: 1.3, status: pending -->
  - **Agent**: AI/ML Dev + Backend Dev
  - **Duration**: 5-7 days
  - **Output**: Recommendation engine with client-side AI processing
  - **Integration**: Complement existing nutrient calculator without conflicts

### Epic 2: Enhanced Mobile Experience (Priority 2)

**Goal**: Transform application into mobile-first platform while preserving desktop functionality

### Epic 3: IoT Sensor Integration (Priority 3)

**Goal**: Enable automated environmental monitoring while preserving manual capabilities

### Epic 4: Advanced Nutrient Calculator (Priority 4)

**Goal**: Enhance calculator with dynamic vendor management and custom formulations

## Technical Implementation Approach

**Database Strategy**: Extend PostgreSQL schema with analytics, IoT, and enhanced nutrient tables
**API Strategy**: Implement versioned endpoints (v1/v2) for backward compatibility
**Frontend Strategy**: Extend React 19.1 components using established patterns
**Testing Strategy**: Integration verification at each story completion

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review Epic 1 Story 1.1 technical requirements
2. **Planning Phase**: Design analytics database schema and processing pipeline
3. **Development Start**: Begin Story 1.1 implementation
4. **Continuous**: Monitor integration requirements
