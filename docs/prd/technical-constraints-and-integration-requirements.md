# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: JavaScript (ES2022), HTML5, CSS3
**Frontend Framework**: React 19.1 with React Router 7, React Hook Form 7.54
**Backend Framework**: Node.js 22 with Express.js 5.1
**Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (recently migrated from SQLite)
**Build System**: Bun (150x faster than previous CRACO setup)
**UI Libraries**: Lucide React icons, Chart.js 4.5, Recharts, React Hot Toast
**Specialized Libraries**: Tesseract.js for OCR functionality
**Infrastructure**: Docker with multi-stage Alpine Linux builds
**Development Tools**: ESLint 9, Prettier, Hot reload development

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing PostgreSQL schema with new tables while maintaining current table structures. Use database migrations for schema evolution and maintain referential integrity with existing plant, environment, and log tables.

**API Integration Strategy**: Create new API endpoints following existing Express.js route patterns. Implement versioning strategy (v1, v2) to maintain compatibility while adding enhanced functionality. Preserve existing authentication and rate limiting middleware.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Develop new React components using established patterns and hooks. Integrate with existing React Router structure and maintain current state management approaches. Extend existing utility functions and API communication layer.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend current test suite with new test files following existing naming conventions. Maintain separation between unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Preserve existing CI/CD pipeline compatibility.

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow established patterns with `backend/routes/`, `frontend/src/components/`, `frontend/src/pages/` structure. New features will create dedicated subdirectories within existing structure.

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain camelCase for JavaScript, kebab-case for CSS classes, PascalCase for React components, and snake_case for database fields.

**Coding Standards**: Continue using ESLint 9 configuration with Prettier formatting. Maintain existing comment standards and JSDoc documentation patterns.

**Documentation Standards**: Follow established markdown documentation patterns. Maintain existing README structure and inline code documentation standards.

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Extend existing Bun-based build process with new frontend assets. Maintain Docker multi-stage build optimization for production deployments.

**Deployment Strategy**: Preserve single-container Docker deployment model. Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates. Maintain existing Docker Compose configuration compatibility.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing Express.js logging with structured logging for new features. Integrate with current error handling and maintain existing log rotation policies.

**Configuration Management**: Extend existing environment variable configuration. Maintain Docker secrets management and preserve existing configuration file patterns.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:

- PostgreSQL migration complexity may impact new schema changes
- Bun build system is relatively new and may have compatibility issues with new dependencies
- React 19.1 concurrent features may conflict with new component architectures

**Integration Risks**:

- OCR functionality dependencies may conflict with new image processing features
- Chart.js and Recharts dual implementation may cause bundle size issues
- Docker Alpine Linux base may lack dependencies for new AI/ML features

**Deployment Risks**:

- Single-container architecture may become resource-constrained with new features
- Port 420 cannabis-themed configuration may conflict with enterprise deployments
- Self-hosted deployment model may limit scalability options

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Implement comprehensive database migration testing with rollback procedures
- Establish Bun compatibility testing for all new dependencies
- Create feature flags for gradual rollout of new capabilities
- Implement container resource monitoring and scaling alerts
- Develop alternative port configuration for enterprise deployments
