## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Establish comprehensive BMAD-driven development workflow for systematic feature enhancement
- Create structured approach for adding new nutrient vendors and calculation algorithms
- Implement advanced analytics and reporting capabilities for cultivation optimization
- Develop mobile-first responsive design improvements
- Enable IoT sensor integration for automated environmental data collection
- Add AI-powered cultivation recommendations based on historical data
- Implement advanced user management and multi-tenant capabilities
- Create comprehensive API for third-party integrations

### Background Context

The Emerald Plant Tracker has evolved from a personal cultivation tool into a comprehensive cannabis management platform. With the recent migration to PostgreSQL and Bun-based build system, the application is now positioned for significant scalability improvements. The current system handles individual plant tracking, environmental monitoring, and nutrient calculations for 10+ professional brands, but lacks advanced analytics, mobile optimization, and AI-driven insights that modern cultivators require. The BMAD methodology will enable systematic enhancement of these capabilities while maintaining the privacy-focused, self-hosted architecture that defines the project.
