# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

New UI components will extend the current dark-theme cannabis aesthetic using the established Lucide React icon system and consistent card-based layout patterns. The enhancement will maintain the existing green (#22c55e) primary color scheme while introducing complementary colors for new feature differentiation. All new components will follow the established hover effects and smooth transition patterns.

- **Advanced Calculator**: Enhanced nutrient calculator with vendor management and custom formulations
- **Multi-Tenant Management**: New admin interface for managing multiple grow operations
- **API Management Console**: New developer interface for third-party integration management
